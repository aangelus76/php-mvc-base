h1. About

A structure I use to get started with PHP projects.

It enables the developer to hook up plugins and let's you use pretty URLs

h2. Test it!

* To test this project, just download the zip (or tar.gz, or fork it etc).
* Place it in your web servers root (remember to include the .htaccess file!).
* start your web server and head to: http://localhost/test


h1. Usage

I've added some README files in the various folders.

The app/router.php is the heart of the system.
All requests go through this file and it decides how the routing of the app 
should be.
You can add additional hooks in this file to add certain routes etc (a better
system for this will arrive one day).

h2. Structure

The root of the project holds a few directories:
/app - This is the folder where your magic will happen. Use the views, controllers and models folder for your app code.
/config - this folder holds a few configuration files. Currently only the connection to the database.
/lib - This is where you should put external libraries and other external files.
/public - This folder holds files that are to be "downloaded" from your app. Stylesheets, javascripts and images used. (and more of course)
/* - files used by the application it self. These should not be changed.

h1. Changelog

I'll start having a changelog at the bottom of this page.

h2. Version 0.3.3

* Added the missing vendor folder.
* Fixed an error with exposing the application root (.htaccess file fix).
* Fixed an error where all files in the vendor scripts folder was read into the system. Only .php files are now read.
